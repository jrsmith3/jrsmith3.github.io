Summary
=======
  * Raw data files should be stored in a single, flat directory (no subdirectories) named `data`.
  * Raw data files stored in the `data` directory should remain pristine and never be altered.
  * If a raw data file needs to be processed or altered for analysis, a copy should be made from the `data` directory and modified locally.
