</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Sample logs are important because they describe the history of individual samples. Individual sample history doesn't make sense to live in individuals' lab notebooks. Samples tend to move from place to place and from person to person having complex and eventful lifecycles. The events that a sample experiences should be recorded in a lab notebook in detail, but it is important to keep markers of all these events in a central location for each sample. Consider the problems if events occuring to a sample were only kept in individuals' lab notebooks. First, assuming everyone keeps perfect notes, understanding the history and order of process events that happened to a sampe would be a very difficult task. Even if everything that a aprtcular sample experienced was performed by a single person and recorded in a single notebook, it would still be an arduous taks to parse the notebook to construct the history. If the sample is handeled by a number fo people, that task acquires a layer of administrative difficulty because now you have to track down everyone and repeatedly parse through lab notebooks to glean the history. This layer adds an additional difficulty because it is easy to miss critical information if you faill to look at a person's notebook who did actually handle the sample. There is never an indication of who you should talk to, so there will always be the doubt that there were indeed events that happened to the sample, but your search just wasn't comprehensive enough.</p>
<p>A sample log is a record of all the events that a sample experiences. The sample log is not a prescription; it doesn't tell where the sample is going, only where the sample has been. The sample log is also not a lab notebook; we forego the full details of the history of the sample in order to get a digestable sense of the sample's history.</p>
<p>There is a small set of metadata that needs to be recorded as an entry on the sample log. Each entry corresponds to an event. Each entry should have a date and time. The entry should name the event. Obviously, events that change the nature of the sample should be recorded: material deposition, material removal, annealing, and things of that sort. Additionally, experiments that characterize the sample should also be recorded: XPS, AFM, XRD, electronic characterization of devices, etc. Third, it is generally useful to record the location of the sample: mounting to a sample holder, loading and unloading into an instrument, etc.</p>
<p>Every entry should also include any necessary description. The description should not go into great detail about the experiment, but it is sometimes useful to annotate the difference between events. For example, if the event is that the sample was loaded, the description would be the instrument. If the event is the sample as AFM performed, the description might be the scan size or the relevant parameter like the RMS roughness. There isn't a hard and fast rule for what info should be recorded as the description, but its more based ont eh experience of hte person writing things down.</p>
<p>Finally, the records should have a reference if applicable. Since the sample log should not be used as a lab notebook, the reference field should include a link back to the coordinates of the full description in the corresponding lab notebook (e.g. UID of notebook and page number). Additionally, most instruments record data taken in a computer file. The reference field should include a link to the computer file(s). These files should be given unique names as discussed in a later section. There are some events that probably don't require a reference, for example loading a sample into an instrument won't likely have a reference unless there was some unusual circumstance around it, in which case the details should be recorded in a lab notebook and the reference noted on the sample log.</p>
<p>A sample log should be started every time a sample is created. This brings up an important point: what is a sample? In the type of science we do, a sample is an individual piece of material. Therefore, if a film is grown on a 2" sapphire wafer, that whole 2" piece is a sample, lets call it 0001. If the sample 0001 is diced into four separate pieces, sample 0001 ceases to exist and four new samples have been created, lets call them 0001-1, 0001-2, 0001-3, and 0001-4. </p>
