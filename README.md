Repository for Joshua Smith's public blog.
==========================================

This repo contains at least two branches: `master` and `source`. The `master` branch is a container for the HTML created by pelican and used to serve the site via github sites. The `source` branch contains the source files for the blog and can be thought of as the main branch of development.

If you are first cloning this repository, you will want to set up the source branch like so:

    git checkout -b source origin/source
